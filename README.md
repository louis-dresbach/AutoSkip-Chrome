![Icon128px](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1289852/189461253-1f4b1d27-b54c-4725-a117-7308d3f1b2a9.png)

Chrome extensions to make watching videos easier.

## Feature-list
- Auto-play videos upon loading the site
- Switch to fullscreen while playing the video
- Skip intro/outro for supported animes (only supports animes where the themes are always at the same time because there is no database available for the timestamps yet). You can either switch it to do skip every time, or display a button similar to the big streaming platforms.
- Create a watchgroup with your friends to watch your favorite series together
- Watchlist to remember what episode you're on
